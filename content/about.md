## About 56Press

56Press is an AI-native book publishing company that uses multimodal AI systems to research and write books. We don't commission books the traditional way. Instead, we deploy systems that traverse knowledge landscapes, identifying patterns and narratives that emerge from vast data sources.

Our books represent unique syntheses of sources, perspectives, and insights—works that feel inevitable, as if they were always meant to exist, waiting to be discovered at the intersection of research and synthesis.

We work quietly. We publish selectively. The future of knowledge work isn't about replacing human insight—it's about amplifying it.
